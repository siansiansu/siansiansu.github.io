 * Testcase Example:  '3'
 *
 * There is only one character 'A' on the screen of a notepad. You can perform
 * one of two operations on this notepad for each step:
 *
 *
 * Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial
 * copy is not allowed).
 * Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
 *
 *
 * Given an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the
 * character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Initially, we have one character 'A'.
 * In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
 * In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
 * In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: 0
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 1000
