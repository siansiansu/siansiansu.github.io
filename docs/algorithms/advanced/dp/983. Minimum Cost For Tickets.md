## [983\. Minimum Cost For Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/)

You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array `days`. Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in **three different ways**:

-   a **1-day** pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars,
-   a **7-day** pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars, and
-   a **30-day** pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

-   For example, if we get a **7-day** pass on day `2`, then we can travel for `7` days: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `8`.

Return _the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** days = \[1,4,6,7,8,20\], costs = \[2,7,15\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs\[0\] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs\[1\] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs\[0\] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** days = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31\], costs = \[2,7,15\]
**Output:** 17
**Explanation:** For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs\[2\] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs\[0\] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= days.length <= 365`
-   `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
-   `days` is in strictly increasing order.
-   `costs.length == 3`
-   `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

```cpp=
class Solution {
public:
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        int lastDay = days.back();
        vector<int> dp(lastDay + 1, 0);

        // 給 days 數列的指針
        int i = 0;

        // 使用一個 loop 從第一天到旅行的最後一天
        for (int day = 1; day < lastDay + 1; day++) {
            // 如果不是出去玩的那一天
            if (day < days[i]) {
                // 雖然不用花錢，但還是要延續前一天的 DP 值
                dp[day] = dp[day - 1];
            } else {
                // 是要出去玩的那一天耶，喔耶！
                // 順便買票囉！

                // 指針到下一天
                i++;

                // 三種組合求最小的花費
                // 一天前買日票
                // 一週前買週票
                // 30 天前買月票
                dp[day] = min({
                    dp[day - 1] + costs[0],
                    dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1],
                    dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2]});
            }
        }
        return dp[lastDay];
    }
};
