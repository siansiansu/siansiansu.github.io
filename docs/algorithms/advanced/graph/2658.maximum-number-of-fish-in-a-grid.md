 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,2,1,0],[4,0,0,3],[1,0,0,4],[0,3,2,0]]'
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D matrix grid of size m x n, where (r, c)
 * represents:
 *
 *
 * A land cell if grid[r][c] = 0, or
 * A water cell containing grid[r][c] fish, if grid[r][c] > 0.
 *
 *
 * A fisher can start at any water cell (r, c) and can do the following
 * operations any number of times:
 *
 *
 * Catch all the fish at cell (r, c), or
 * Move to any adjacent water cell.
 *
 *
 * Return the maximum number of fish the fisher can catch if he chooses his
 * starting cell optimally, or 0 if no water cell exists.
 *
 * An adjacent cell of the cell (r, c), is one of the cells (r, c + 1), (r, c -
 * 1), (r + 1, c) or (r - 1, c) if it exists.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: grid = [[0,2,1,0],[4,0,0,3],[1,0,0,4],[0,3,2,0]]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The fisher can start at cell (1,3) and collect 3 fish, then
 * move to cell (2,3)Â and collect 4 fish.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The fisher can start at cells (0,0) or (3,3) and collect a
 * single fish.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 10
 * 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10
 *
 *
