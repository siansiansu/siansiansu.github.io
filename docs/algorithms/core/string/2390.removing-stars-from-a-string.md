 * Testcase Example:  '"leet**cod*e"'
 *
 * You are given a string s, which contains stars *.
 *
 * In one operation, you can:
 *
 *
 * Choose a star in s.
 * Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the
 * star itself.
 *
 *
 * Return the string after all stars have been removed.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
 * It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
 * Output: "lecoe"
 * Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
 * - The closest character to the 1^st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes
 * "lee*cod*e".
 * - The closest character to the 2^nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes
 * "lecod*e".
 * - The closest character to the 3^rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes
 * "lecoe".
 * There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: s = "erase*****"
 * Output: ""
 * Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *.
 * The operation above can be performed on s.
