# Binary Tree

Tree Types
----------

Binary trees come in several variations, each with unique properties:

1.  **Complete Binary Tree (CBT)**: Every level is filled, except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
2.  **Perfect Binary Tree (PBT)**: All interior nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
3.  **Full Binary Tree (FBT)**: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
4.  **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater.

Tree Traversal
--------------

Understanding different traversal methods is crucial for working with binary trees:

1.  **Inorder Traversal**: Left subtree, Root, Right subtree
2.  **Preorder Traversal**: Root, Left subtree, Right subtree
3.  **Postorder Traversal**: Left subtree, Right subtree, Root
4.  **Level Order Traversal**: Visit nodes level by level, from left to right
