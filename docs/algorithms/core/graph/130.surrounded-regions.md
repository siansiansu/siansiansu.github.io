 * Testcase Example:  '[["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]'
 *
 * You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture
 * regions that are surrounded:
 *
 *
 * Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or
 * vertically.
 * Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
 * Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the
 * region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the
 * board.
 *
 *
 * To capture a surrounded region, replace all 'O's with 'X's in-place within
 * the original board. You do not need to return anything.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: board =
 * [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 *
 * Output:
 * [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the
 * edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: board = [["X"]]
 *
 * Output: [["X"]]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == board.length
 * n == board[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 200
 * board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
