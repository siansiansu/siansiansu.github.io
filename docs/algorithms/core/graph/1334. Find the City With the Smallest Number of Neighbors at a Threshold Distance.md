# [1334\. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/)

 Hint - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheCity(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int distanceThreshold)
    {
        // Initialize the distance matrix with a large number

        // Distance from each city to itself is zero

        // Set the distance for each edge in the graph

        // Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find shortest paths between all pairs of cities

        // To store the city with the minimum count of reachable cities
        // To store the minimum number of reachable cities

        // Iterate over each city to find the one with the fewest reachable cities within the threshold
        for ()
        {

            // Count how many cities are reachable within the distance threshold

            // Update the result if this city has fewer reachable cities
        }
        // Return the city with the fewest reachable cities
    }
};
