# [3228\. Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-to-move-ones-to-the-end/)

:::spoiler Hint
```cpp=
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(string s)
    {
        // Initialize the result variable to store the maximum number of operations.
        // Initialize the counter to count consecutive '1's.

        // Iterate over each character in the string.
        for ()
        {
            // If the current character is '1', increment the counter.
            // If the current character is '0' and the previous character was '1',
            // add the count of '1's to the result.
        }
        // Return the result which is the maximum number of operations.
